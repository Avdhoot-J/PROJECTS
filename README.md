# PROJECTS
1. Drug Prediction
2. Fruit Recognition
3. Sentimental Analysis
4. Pneumonia Detection


With the intent of sharpening my python skills, I acquired knowledge of AI, and ML in python by making these hands-on projects. It was back in 2019 when I started a Drug prediction project by using python. Eventually, completed these projects so far. Instead of just keeping such knowledge to myself, I rather decided to share this on GitHub. In addition, these projects require a CSV file for each particular project. One can feel free to browse it on the internet for such CSV files. Therein, many CSV files are available, and can try using one of them.
